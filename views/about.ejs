        <h2 class="text-light-blue">Jeoplit</h2>
        <p>Jeoplit is a web application that combines the studying elements of Quizlet and the game functionality of Jeopardy to provide students another venue of studying.
          We believe that when you are enjoying what you are studying, it better reinforces the topics and concepts learned. It was developed by Mike Panuelos and Ryan Knobel for their Programming Languages course part two presentation that highlights the strengths and capabalities of JavaScript.
          With this project, we intended to highlight JavaScript's ability to develop both for the server and client side. We also wanted to highlight JavaScript's
          concurrent abilities with our web scraping, done with the use of Puppeteer, dynamic content creation with EJS files and database queries, event handling and event-driven and object-oriented programming, and destructuring.
          The Application was developed with the programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the following tools and frameworks: Node.JS, Express.JS, and Bootstrap. 
          The initial version of the web application entails the following functionality that we seek to improve: data scraping for content, a log in and sign up system, and a contact form page.
          We hope you join and continue with us on this journey of improving Jeoplit by contacting us if any problems or issues or by contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/snipergz/jeoplit.git">source code</a>.
          Let's all keep learning well, working hard, and studying smart and we hope that Jeoplit assists you in doing so. 
        </p>

          Hey, it's me: Ryan. This is the first major project I have taken part of, which is kinda cool I guess. Random facts about me: 
          <ul>
            <li>Love guitar (Casper Esmann my fav) </li>
            <li>Love traveling to new places </li>
            <li>Love to draw (but also suck at it) </li>
            <li>Soccer is my favorite sport </li>
            <li>Messi >= Ronaldo</li>
            <li>Learned to program in high school robotics club (Java)</li>
            <li>... but JavaScript is life </li>
            <li>Pizza Hut has the best pizza</li>
          </ul>  
          I also play video games for fun, although I am kinda outdated and still play on the Wii and PS2. Does that make me the best Mario Kart Wii racer and Garage Band guitarist?
          Anyways, here is my <a href="https://github.com/rknobel1">github</a> account for those that are interested.
